In my teaching, I strive to empower students with fundamental computer science principles that are not only integral to their academic success but also have profound real-world applications. Through concise and engaging delivery, I aim to demystify complex concepts, fostering a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. 


I have been teaching the following courses during the academic years 2022-2024 at the University of Auckland:

1. Operating System (COMPSCI 340, SOFTENG 350)
2. Large-scale Software Development (COMPSCI 325, SOFTENG 325)
3. Human-Computer Interaction (COMPSCI 345)
