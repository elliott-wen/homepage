I am a lecturer at the University of Auckland. My research interests include metaverse, software enginerring, and mobile computing. 

I am actively seeking highly motivated Ph.D. students and Research Assistants. Our focus is on advancing research in the fascinating field of VR gaming. We would like to do more research on motion sickness, physical safety, and content moderation in VR applications.

At my spare time, I have a keen passion for both indulging in and reverse-engineering classic games from the past, such as MapleStory and Red Alert 2. Additionally, I enjoy the intricate process of constructing operating system kernels and developing network devices.
