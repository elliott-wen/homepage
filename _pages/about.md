I am a lecturer at the University of Auckland. My research interests include metaverse, software enginerring, and mobile computing. 

I have a keen passion for both indulging in and reverse-engineering classic games from the past, such as MapleStory and Red Alert 2. Additionally, I enjoy the intricate process of constructing operating system kernels and developing network devices. 

I am actively seeking highly motivated Ph.D. students and Research Assistants. Our focus is on advancing research in the fascinating field of gaming. Yes, you read it correctly â€“ gaming. To be more specific, game engines and graphics drivers.
